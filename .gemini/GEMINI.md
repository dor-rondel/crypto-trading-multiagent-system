# GEMINI.md

## Project Context

This repository contains an event-driven, agentic trading simulation platform.

The system trades exclusively on testnets while using real market data to generate signals.
The primary LLM provider is **Groq** for high-speed inference.
**LangSmith** is used for workflow observability and tracing.

Supported chains:
- Solana Devnet (`solana-py`)
- Ethereum Sepolia (`AgentKit/CDP`)
- Avalanche Fuji (`AgentKit/CDP`)

# Architectural Constraints

## Plan → Validate → Execute

The system follows a strict separation between planning and execution.

### Agents Generate Plans
Agents produce structured output using Pydantic models to ensure validation and type safety.

Example Plan Model:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class Action(BaseModel):
    action: str = Field(..., description="BUY or SELL")
    asset: str = Field(..., description="Asset symbol e.g. ETH")
    allocation_pct: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1)

class TradePlan(BaseModel):
    plan_type: str = "trade"
    actions: List[Action]
```

### Executors Execute Plans
Executors perform blockchain operations.
- **EVM Chains:** Use `AgentKit` and the `Coinbase CDP SDK` for swaps and wallet management. `web3.py` may be used for low-level deterministic checks.
- **Solana:** Use `solana-py` for transaction construction and signing.
- Executors must never generate strategy decisions.

---

## Wallet Management & Capital

### Three-Wallet Strategy
The system maintains three distinct wallets, one for each supported chain.
- Each wallet uses **USDC** as its base "bank" currency.
- Trades are simulated by swapping USDC for the target asset and back.

### Programmatic Wallet Creation & Persistence
Wallets should be loaded from environment variables. If not found, they must be created programmatically.
- **EVM:** `AgentKit/CDP` handles wallet persistence. Credentials should be stored in `.env`.
- **Solana:** The system must generate a keypair if one is not provided in `.env` and store the private key/seed phrase for future sessions.
- **Initialization:** Upon creation, the system should output the wallet addresses for manual funding via testnet faucets (Native gas and USDC).

### Security
- Agents never see private keys.
- Private keys/CDP credentials must never be logged or committed.
- Wallets are strictly for testnet use.

---

## No Agent-Driven Transaction Construction
Agents propose actions; deterministic services (using AgentKit or solana-py) construct and sign transactions.

---

## Event-Driven Architecture
The system is not request-response driven.
Workflows are resumed through events (MARKET_SIGNAL, TX_CONFIRMED, TX_FAILED, etc.).
Workflows should persist state and sleep while waiting.

---

## Workflow Philosophy
A workflow is not a continuously running agent.
A workflow is a state machine: Start → Generate Plan → Validate → Execute → Wait → Resume → Complete.

---

# Component Responsibilities

## Wallet Manager
Responsibilities:
- Programmatically create/load wallets for all three chains.
- Fetch balances for native tokens and USDC.
- Provide wallet addresses for funding.

## Market Watcher
Responsibilities:
- Poll market data providers (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance).
- Detect trading signals and emit events.
Must not execute trades or modify portfolios.

## Planner Agent
Responsibilities:
- Analyze market state and portfolio state.
- Generate plans using structured output.
Must not perform execution or sign transactions.

## Validator
Responsibilities:
- Verify balances, wallet availability, position limits, and chain health.
Must remain deterministic.

## Executor
Responsibilities:
- Execute plans and submit transactions.
- Track transaction identifiers.
Must not create strategy.

## Transaction Monitor
Responsibilities:
- Poll chain state and verify confirmations/failures.
- Emit workflow events.
Must not contain LLM logic.

## Portfolio Manager
Responsibilities:
- Track balances, positions, reserved capital, and workflow ownership.
Must remain deterministic.

# Multi-Workflow Execution
Multiple workflows may execute simultaneously (e.g., Workflow A buys ETH, Workflow B buys AVAX). The system must support concurrent execution.

---

# Capital Reservation
Before execution, workflows reserve funds to prevent race conditions. Subsequent workflows must respect these reservations.

---

# Persistence Requirements
Workflow state, pending transactions, plans, portfolio state, and reservations must be recoverable. System restarts must not lose active workflows.

---

# Code Standards
- All public classes, functions, and modules require docstrings.
- Type hints are required.
- Use Pydantic models or dataclasses over generic dictionaries.

---

# Testing Philosophy
- Every planner decision must be testable independently without blockchain access.
- Executors and monitors must be testable with mocked chain responses.
- Favor deterministic tests.

# Future Direction
